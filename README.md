# Fashion-MNIST
I'm adding an exercise notebook that runs the model in the browser using Fashion MNIST dataset.<br>
Download the three files and run fashion-mnist.html <br>
Draw any object like T-shirt, boots, handbag, etc. on the given canvas to check if the model is able to classify your drawing perfectly!
